/**
 * @file
 *
 * Gate for the shared script helpers under `scripts/helpers/`.
 *
 * Those files are PEER COPIES, not this repo's own code: `obsidian-test-mocks` and
 * `obsidian-typings-crawler` carry the same roster, most of it descended from
 * `obsidian-dev-utils/src/script-utils/`, and a change to one is supposed to be a change to all three. Nothing
 * gated them. `check:vendored-eslint-rules` walks for the names `obsidian-dev-utils` publishes under
 * `src/script-utils/linters/eslint-rules/`, so it can never see a file here; the roster was kept in step by
 * hand-diffing, and five of the eleven files had fallen behind unobserved before 2026-09-20.
 *
 * What this asserts is BYTE-IDENTITY against one peer, after a recorded transform. That is stronger than the
 * shape baseline `obsidian-test-mocks` keeps over its docs pipeline, and identity can be asserted here because these
 * copies genuinely do not diverge: ten of the eleven shared sources hashed identically across all three
 * checkouts when this was written. A gate that asserts identity reports every drift rather than only a change
 * of shape.
 *
 * Six things it does deliberately:
 *
 * 1. **It fetches ONE peer, and the peer is `obsidian-test-mocks`.** That repo carries the richest roster - 19
 *    files against this repo's 15, re-counted 2026-09-23 - and was byte-identical here on every shared file but
 *    one, so it is the natural side to compare against. `obsidian-typings/obsidian-typings-crawler` carries the same helpers and
 *    is a second opinion, not a second gate: fetching both would double the network cost to answer the same
 *    question twice.
 * 2. **The roster is the TREE `scripts/helpers/`, minus `eslint-rules/`.** One predicate ({@link isRosterPath})
 *    decides membership on both sides, so the two rosters cannot be scoped differently by accident. The
 *    carve-out is the other gate's subject: those sources are compared against `obsidian-dev-utils`, which is a
 *    different upstream and a different set of recorded deltas. `@types/` is deliberately IN - it holds shared
 *    copies too.
 * 3. **A file this repo does not carry is NOT drift.** The peer's roster is a superset by construction, so the
 *    comparison is over the intersection and anything on one side only is reported as information. Taking a
 *    peer-only helper is a decision somebody makes, not a sync a gate can demand.
 * 4. **A deliberate difference is recorded in {@link DIVERGENCE_EXCEPTIONS}, with the reason, and the record
 *    EXPIRES.** A file that differs with no exception fails; a file that is byte-identical while an exception
 *    still claims a divergence fails too, because a stale exception is a live one's hiding place. A difference
 *    that is mechanical rather than deliberate goes in {@link TRANSFORM_ARMS} instead, which reproduces this
 *    repo's copy from the peer's so that every later run enforces it.
 * 5. **This repo's side is READ FROM THE INDEX** ({@link readLocalText}), not from the working tree. This runs
 *    from `nano-staged` beside `lint:fix` and `format`, which rewrite a staged file in place - one of the ways
 *    these copies drift. nano-staged builds one task group per pattern and runs the groups with `Promise.all`
 *    (measured against 1.0.2, 2026-09-19), so no key order makes this follow them; reading the index makes the
 *    ordering irrelevant rather than trying to enforce it. See `scripts/helpers/git-content.ts`. An untracked
 *    helper has no staged bytes and is read from disk.
 * 6. **The peer list comes from the peer**, as one `git/trees?recursive=1` call rather than a directory walk of
 *    the contents API: that API is not recursive, and its rate limit - 60 requests an hour per address
 *    unauthenticated - is shared with `check:vendored-eslint-rules`, which runs from the same hook and the same
 *    CI job. A truncated tree is thrown on rather than read, because a listing that silently lost entries is
 *    the one failure mode a listing exists to prevent.
 *
 * This runs from `nano-staged` on a staged helper, and also from CI. The CI half is what catches the drift
 * direction the pre-commit half cannot: a copy is only staged when somebody is editing it, so the peer moving
 * underneath a file nobody touches is invisible to a hook.
 *
 * Offline, or anywhere the fetch is unwelcome, this is turned off the way every script here is turned off:
 * `CHECK_HELPERS_SYNC=0`, via {@link exitIfScriptDisabled}. That is an explicit opt-out rather than a silent
 * skip, so a network failure is still reported as a failure.
