/**
 * @file
 *
 * Tests for the index read both of this repo's byte-identity gates depend on --
 * `check:vendored-eslint-rules` and `check:helpers-sync`.
 *
 * Taken from `obsidian-test-mocks`, which until 2026-09-23 carried the only copy of this suite while this
 * repo carried the authoritative copy of the file under test. Four of its five cases came across unchanged;
 * the two departures and the one addition are recorded below, because a peer copy whose differences are not
 * written down is drift waiting to be "converged" in the wrong direction.
 *
 * The fixture for everything that can use it is **this repository's own index** rather than a scratch repo:
 * those properties are properties of how `git cat-file` hands bytes back, and a repo built for the test would
 * prove them about that repo rather than about the checkout the gates actually run in.
 *
 * The two that matter most are the two reasons `readIndexContent` does not go through `execFromRoot` -- a
 * binary blob survives, and a trailing newline is not eaten. Both are silent failures waiting to happen: the
 * second would report every vendored rule source as differing from upstream by its last line.
 *
 * ## The two departures from the peer's copy
 *
 * - **The manifest name.** The peer asserts `obsidian-test-mocks`; this repo's package is
 *   `typescript-template`. Nothing else about that case changes.
 * - **The binary case has no fixture in this checkout, so it is the one case that DOES build a scratch repo.**
 *   The peer reads a vendored Inter TTF; measured 2026-09-23, **none of this repo's 71 tracked files contains
 *   a NUL byte**, so the fixture rule above cannot reach this property here and the choice is a scratch repo
 *   or no coverage at all. The property is worth the departure: `git-content.ts` says in its own header that
 *   nothing tracked here is such a blob *today* and that a primitive whose exactness depends on which files a
 *   caller hands it is the wrong thing to build on -- which is an argument for asserting it, not for leaving
 *   it to the siblings that do track binary assets.
 *
 * ## The one case the peer does not have
 *
 * A path git cannot find and a folder that is not a repository both exit 128, and `isMissingPath` tells them
 * apart by the message alone: the first is reported as an absent blob, the second is thrown. That distinction
 * is the single thing all three copies of `git-content.ts` word differently, and this repo's wording is the
 * current one -- so this is the copy of the suite that should pin it.
