 *
 * Reading a tracked file as it is about to be COMMITTED, rather than as it sits in the working tree.
 *
 * `check:vendored-eslint-rules` asserts something about the bytes of a file that is going to be committed,
 * and it runs from `nano-staged` alongside `lint:fix` and `format`, which rewrite staged files in place.
 * **nano-staged builds one task group per pattern and runs the groups with `Promise.all`** (measured against
 * nano-staged 1.0.2, 2026-09-19), so no arrangement of keys makes that gate follow the fixer: sequencing
 * exists within a single key's command list and nowhere else. A gate reading the working tree therefore
 * races the fixer, and which bytes it sees is a coin toss.
 *
 * Reading the index instead makes the ordering irrelevant rather than enforced. It also makes the gate
 * answer the question it is actually asked when a developer runs it by hand mid-edit: the subject is what
 * will be committed, not whatever the editor happens to be holding.
 *
 * On a clean checkout - CI, or a fresh clone - the index and the working tree hold the same bytes, so this
 * changes nothing there.
 *
 * ## Why this does not go through `execFromRoot`
 *
 * Both reasons are properties of `scripts/helpers/exec.ts` as it stands (re-read 2026-09-20), not of how it
 * is called:
 *
 * - **It strips one trailing newline**, in its `stdout` `end` handler. Every vendored rule source ends with
 *   one, so every one of them would read as differing from upstream by its last line. This one alone would
 *   be enough.
 * - **It decodes stdout as UTF-8**, accumulating `data.toString('utf-8')` into a string, so a blob that is
 *   not valid UTF-8 does not survive the round trip. Nothing tracked here is such a blob today - but a
 *   byte-identity primitive whose exactness depends on which files a caller happens to hand it is the wrong
 *   thing to build on, and the sibling repos this file is hand-synced with do track binary assets.
 *
 * So this spawns `git` directly and concatenates Buffers.

/**
 * Reads one tracked file's content out of the git index - stage 0, the bytes `git commit` would write.
 *
 * The path is passed in the `:./<path>` form, which git resolves against the process's directory prefix
 * rather than against the top of the working tree. That is what keeps this correct when the package root this
 * is called with is not itself the repository root - a self-contained subpackage, for instance.
 *
 * No smudge filter or line-ending conversion is applied: `git cat-file blob` hands back the blob verbatim,
 * which for this repo means the LF-normalized bytes `.gitattributes` declares.
 *
 * @param root - The directory the path is relative to, which is also the directory git is run from.
 * @param repoRelativePath - The file's path relative to `root`, posix-spelled.
 * @returns The staged bytes, or `null` when the path has no stage-0 index entry - it is untracked, staged
 * for deletion, or unmerged.
