   * ways these files drift, so this check has to read what is about to be committed — and where its key
   * sits cannot buy that. **nano-staged builds one task group per pattern and runs the groups with
   * `Promise.all`** (measured against nano-staged 1.0.2, 2026-09-19), so this group RACES `lint:fix` rather
   * than following it; sequencing exists within a single key's command list and nowhere else, which is why
   * `lint:fix` then `format` under one key really is ordered. Key order here is only what perfectionist
   * sorts it to, and says nothing about when anything runs.
   *
   * So the ordering is not enforced, it is made IRRELEVANT: the gate reads its subject out of the git index
   * rather than off disk (`scripts/helpers/git-content.ts`), which is the same bytes whether `lint:fix` has
   * run or not. Moving this key, or letting a future nano-staged order the groups differently, changes
   * nothing.
   *
   * It takes no filenames: the glob is only what decides whether it runs at all, so an ordinary commit
   * touching no vendored file fetches nothing.
